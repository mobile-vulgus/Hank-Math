# Hank Math!

This is a simple Python program I wrote for my son to practice math problems (and for me to practice Python). It randomly selects two integers between a defined range, gets the user's input to the problem, and records all the variables of the problem(s) in class instances to show a final score. If you want to play it, it should run fine in most \*NIX-like terminals, though on Windows a 'clear' screen os function needs to be changed to 'cls' to work properly.
